Clear cell Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer which comprises the majority of all renal cell carcinomas. Many efforts have been made to identify biomarkers which could help healthcare professionals better treat this kind of cancer. With extensive public data available, we conducted a machine learning study to determine a gene signature that could indicate patient survival with high accuracy. Through the min-Redundancy and Max-Relevance algorithm we generated a signature of 13 genes highly correlated to patient outcomes. These findings reveal potential strategies for personalized medicine in the clinical practice.
